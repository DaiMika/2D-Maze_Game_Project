Test Maze Logic
Description: Conduct thorough testing of the maze logic to ensure it works as expected
Testing the maze logic involves verifying that the maze generation, player movement, collision detection, and completion check functionalities are all working correctly. This includes both manual and automated testing approaches to cover different aspects of the logic.

Testing Plan
Unit Tests
Integration Tests
User Acceptance Tests
Edge Case Tests


1. Unit Tests
Unit tests focus on individual components of the maze logic. I will use a JavaScript testing framework like Jest to write these tests.

// maze.test.js

const { generateMaze, canMove } = require('./maze');

test('maze generation creates a valid maze', () => {
    const maze = generateMaze(10, 10);
    expect(maze.length).toBe(10);
    expect(maze[0].length).toBe(10);
    expect(maze[1][1]).toBe(0); // Start position should be open
    expect(maze[maze.length - 2][maze[0].length - 2]).toBe(0); // End position should be open
});

test('canMove function correctly detects walls and paths', () => {
    const maze = [
        [1, 1, 1],
        [1, 0, 1],
        [1, 0, 1],
        [1, 0, 1],
        [1, 1, 1]
    ];
    expect(canMove(1, 1, maze)).toBe(true);  // Open path
    expect(canMove(0, 0, maze)).toBe(false); // Wall
    expect(canMove(2, 2, maze)).toBe(false); // Wall
});


2. Integration Tests
This tests verify that different parts of the system work together as expected. This includes player movement and maze completion checks.

// integration.test.js

const { generateMaze, canMove, movePlayer, checkCompletion } = require('./maze');

test('player can move through open paths', () => {
    const maze = generateMaze(10, 10);
    let playerPosition = { x: 1, y: 1 };

    playerPosition = movePlayer(playerPosition, 'ArrowRight', maze);
    expect(playerPosition).toEqual({ x: 2, y: 1 });

    playerPosition = movePlayer(playerPosition, 'ArrowDown', maze);
    expect(playerPosition).toEqual({ x: 2, y: 2 });
});

test('player cannot move through walls', () => {
    const maze = generateMaze(10, 10);
    let playerPosition = { x: 1, y: 1 };

    playerPosition = movePlayer(playerPosition, 'ArrowLeft', maze);
    expect(playerPosition).toEqual({ x: 1, y: 1 }); // No movement through wall
});

test('game recognizes maze completion', () => {
    const maze = generateMaze(10, 10);
    let playerPosition = { x: maze.length - 2, y: maze[0].length - 2 };

    const isComplete = checkCompletion(playerPosition, maze);
    expect(isComplete).toBe(true); // Player reached the goal
});


3. User Acceptance Tests
User acceptance tests involve manually playing the game to ensure the logic is working as intended from a user's perspective. This can include navigating the maze, verifying that the player cannot move through walls, and ensuring the game acknowledges completion.

Steps:

Start the Game: Open the game in a web browser.
Navigate the Maze: Use arrow keys to move the player.
Verify Movements: Ensure the player can move through paths but not through walls.
Check Completion: Reach the goal and verify the game shows a completion message.

4. Edge Case Tests
Edge case tests ensure the game handles unusual scenarios gracefully.

For instance;

Small Maze: Test with a very small maze (e.g., 2x2) to ensure the game logic still functions.
Large Maze: Test with a very large maze (e.g., 100x100) to verify performance and correctness.
No Path: Test with a maze where the start and end positions are blocked off to ensure the game handles unsolvable mazes correctly.

// edgecase.test.js

const { generateMaze, canMove, checkCompletion } = require('./maze');

test('handles small maze correctly', () => {
    const maze = generateMaze(2, 2);
    expect(maze.length).toBe(2);
    expect(maze[0].length).toBe(2);
});

test('handles large maze correctly', () => {
    const maze = generateMaze(100, 100);
    expect(maze.length).toBe(100);
    expect(maze[0].length).toBe(100);
});

test('handles unsolvable maze correctly', () => {
    const maze = [
        [1, 1, 1],
        [1, 0, 1],
        [1, 1, 1]
    ];
    let playerPosition = { x: 1, y: 1 };
    const isComplete = checkCompletion(playerPosition, maze);
    expect(isComplete).toBe(false);
});


In summary, By conducting the neccessary  testing, it is  ensured that the core maze logic is robust and functions as expected under various conditions. This includes unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for combined functionality, user acceptance tests for real-world usage, and edge case tests for unusual scenarios.
